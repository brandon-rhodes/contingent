</style><p>Build systems have long been a standard tool
within computer programming.</p>
<p>The standard <tt class="docutils literal">make</tt> build system,
for which its author won the ACM Software System Award,
was first developed in&nbsp;1976.
It not only lets you declare
that an output file depends upon one (or more) inputs,
but lets you do this recursively.
A&nbsp;program, for example, might depend upon an object file
which itself depends upon the corresponding source code:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
prog: main.o
        cc -o prog main.o

main.o: main.c
        cc -C -o main.o main.c
</pre>
<p>Should <tt class="docutils literal">make</tt> discover, upon its next invocation,
that the <tt class="docutils literal">main.c</tt> source code file
now has a more recent modify time than <tt class="docutils literal">main.o</tt>,
then it will not only rebuild the <tt class="docutils literal">main.o</tt> object file
but will also rebuild <tt class="docutils literal">prog</tt> itself.</p>
<p>Build systems are a common semester project
posed for undergraduate computer science students —
not only because build systems are used in nearly all software projects,
but because their construction involves fundamental data structures
and algorithms involving directed graphs
(which this chapter will later discuss in more detail).
With decades of use and practice behind build systems,
one might expect them to have become completely general-purpose
and ready for even the most extravagant demands.</p>
<p>But, in fact, one kind of common interaction between build artifacts —
the problem of dynamic cross-referencing —
is handled so poorly by most build systems
that in this chapter we are inspired
to not only rehearse the standard solution
and data structures used classically to solve the <tt class="docutils literal">make</tt> problem,
but to extend that solution dramatically to a far more demanding domain.</p>
<p>The problem, again, is cross-referencing.
Where do cross-references tend to emerge?
In text documents, documentation, and printed books!</p>
<div class="section" id="the-problem-building-document-systems">
<h1>The Problem: Building Document Systems</h1>
<p>Systems to rebuild formatted documents from source texts
always seem to do too much work, or too little.</p>
<p>They do too much work
when they respond to a minor edit
by making you wait for unrelated chapters
to be re-parsed and re-formatted.
But they can also rebuild too little,
leaving you with an inconsistent final product.</p>
<p>Consider Sphinx&nbsp;1.2.3, the current version
of the document builder
that is used for both the official Python language documentation
and many other projects in the Python community.
A&nbsp;Sphinx project’s <tt class="docutils literal">index.rst</tt>
will usually include a table of contents:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Table of Contents
=================

.. toctree::

   install.rst
   tutorial.rst
   api.rst
</pre>
<p>This list of chapter filenames
tells Sphinx to include a link to each of the three named chapters
when it builds the <tt class="docutils literal">index.html</tt> output file.
It will also include links to any sections within each chapter.
Stripped of its markup,
the text that results from the above title
and <tt class="docutils literal">toctree</tt> command might&nbsp;be:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Table of Contents

• Installation

• Newcomers Tutorial
    • Hello, World
    • Adding Logging

• API Reference
    • Handy Functions
    • Obscure Classes
</pre>
<p>This table of contents, as you can see, is a mash-up
of information from four different files.
While its basic order and structure come from <tt class="docutils literal">index.rst</tt>,
the actual title of each chapter and section
is pulled from the three chapter source files themselves.</p>
<p>If you later reconsider the tutorial’s chapter title —
after all, the word “newcomer” sounds so antique,
as if your users are settlers who have just arrived in pioneer Wyoming —
then you would edit the first line of <tt class="docutils literal">tutorial.rst</tt>
and write something better:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
-Newcomers Tutorial
+Beginners Tutorial
 ==================

 Welcome to the tutorial!
 This text will take you through the basics of...
</pre>
<p>When you are ready to rebuild,
Sphinx will do exactly the right thing!
It will rebuild both the tutorial chapter itself,
and also rebuild the index.
(Piping the output into <tt class="docutils literal">cat</tt> makes Sphinx
announce each rebuilt file on a separate line,
instead of using bare carriage returns
to repeatedly overwrite a single line with these progress updates.)</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ make html | cat
⋮
writing output... [ 50%] index
writing output... [100%] tutorial
</pre>
<p>Because Sphinx chose to rebuild both documents,
not only will <tt class="docutils literal">tutorial.html</tt> now feature its new title up at the top,
but the output <tt class="docutils literal">index.html</tt> will display the updated chapter title
in the table of contents.
Sphinx has rebuilt everything so that the output is consistent.</p>
<p>What if your edit to <tt class="docutils literal">tutorial.rst</tt> is more minor?</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
 Beginners Tutorial
 ==================

-Welcome to the tutorial!
+Welcome to our project tutorial!
 This text will take you through the basics of...
</pre>
<p>In this case there is no need to rebuild <tt class="docutils literal">index.html</tt>
because this minor edit to the interior of a paragraph
does not change any of the information in the table of contents.
But it turns out that Sphinx is not quite as clever
as it might have at first appeared!
It will go ahead and perform the redundant work of rebuilding
<tt class="docutils literal">index.html</tt> even though the resulting contents
will be exactly the same.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
writing output... [ 50%] index
writing output... [100%] tutorial
</pre>
<p>You can run <tt class="docutils literal">diff</tt>
on the “before” and “after” versions of <tt class="docutils literal">index.html</tt>
to confirm that your small edit
has had zero effect on the project front page —
yet Sphinx made you wait while it was rebuilt anyway.</p>
<p>You might not even notice the extra rebuild effort
for small documents that are easy to compile.
But the delay to your workflow can become significant
when you are making frequent tweaks and edits
to documents that are long, complex, or that involve the generation
of multimedia like plots or animations.
While Sphinx is at least making an effort
not to rebuild every chapter when you make a single change —
it has not, for example, rebuilt <tt class="docutils literal">install.html</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">api.html</tt>
in response to your <tt class="docutils literal">tutorial.rst</tt> edit —
it is doing more than is necessary.</p>
<p>But it turns out that Sphinx does something even worse:
it sometimes does too little,
leaving you with inconsistent output that could be noticed by users.</p>
<p>To see one of Sphinx’s simplest failure modes,
first add a cross reference to the top of your API documentation:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
 API Reference
 =============

+Before reading this, try reading our :doc:`tutorial`!
+
 The sections below list every function
 and every single class and method offered...
</pre>
<p>With its usual caution as regards the table of contents,
Sphinx will dutifully rebuild both this API reference document
as well as the <tt class="docutils literal">index.html</tt> home page of your project:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
writing output... [ 50%] api
writing output... [100%] index
</pre>
<p>In the <tt class="docutils literal">api.html</tt> output file you can confirm
that Sphinx has included the attractive human-readable title
of the tutorial chapter into the cross reference’s anchor tag:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;p&gt;Before reading this, try reading our
&lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;tutorial.html&quot;&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Beginners Tutorial&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
<p>What if you now make another edit
to the title at the top of the <tt class="docutils literal">tutorial.rst</tt> file?
You will have invalidated <em>three</em> output files:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The title at the top of <tt class="docutils literal">tutorial.html</tt> is now out of date,
so the file needs to be rebuilt.</li>
<li>The table of contents in <tt class="docutils literal">index.html</tt> still has the old title,
so that document needs to be rebuilt.</li>
<li>The embedded cross reference in the first paragraph of <tt class="docutils literal">api.html</tt>
still has the old chapter title,
and also needs to be rebuilt.</li>
</ol>
<p>What does Sphinx do?</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
writing output... [ 50%] index
writing output... [100%] tutorial
</pre>
<p>Whoops.</p>
<p>Only two files were rebuilt, not three.
Sphinx has failed to correctly rebuild your documentation.</p>
<p>If you now push your HTML to the web,
users will see the old title in the cross reference
at the top of <tt class="docutils literal">api.html</tt>
but then a different title — the new one —
once the link has carried them to <tt class="docutils literal">tutorial.html</tt> itself.
This can happen for many kinds of cross reference that Sphinx supports:
chapter titles, section titles, paragraphs,
classes, methods, and functions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="build-systems-and-consistency">
<h1>Build Systems and Consistency</h1>
<p>The problem outlined above is not specific to Sphinx.
Not only does it haunt other document systems, like LaTeX,
but it can even plague projects
that are simply trying to direct compilation steps
with the venerable <tt class="docutils literal">make</tt> utility,
if their assets happen to cross-reference in interesting ways.</p>
<p>As the problem is ancient and universal,
its solution is of equally long lineage:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ rm -r _build/
$ make html
</pre>
<p>If you remove all of the output,
you are guaranteed a complete rebuild!
Some projects even alias <tt class="docutils literal">rm</tt> <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-r</span></tt> a target named <tt class="docutils literal">clean</tt>
so that only a quick <tt class="docutils literal">make</tt> <tt class="docutils literal">clean</tt> is necessary to wipe the slate.</p>
<p>By eliminating every copy of every intermediate or output asset,
a hefty <tt class="docutils literal">rm</tt> <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-r</span></tt> is able to force the build to start over again
with nothing cached — with no memory of its earlier state
that could possibly lead to a stale product!</p>
<p>But could we develop a better approach?</p>
<p>What if your build system were a persistent process
that noticed every chapter title, every section title,
and every cross referenced phrase
as it passed from the source code of one document
into the text of another?
Its decisions about whether to rebuild other documents
after a change to a single source file could be precise,
instead of mere guesses,
and correct,
instead of leaving the output in an inconsistent state.</p>
<p>The result would be a system like the old static <tt class="docutils literal">make</tt> tool,
but which learned the dependencies between files as they were built —
that added and removed dependencies dynamically
as cross references were added, updated, and then later deleted.</p>
<p>In the sections that follow we will construct such a tool in Python,
named Contingent,
that guarantees correctness in the presence of dynamic dependencies
while performing the fewest possible rebuild steps.
While Contingent can be applied to any problem domain,
we will run it against a small version of the problem outlined above.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="linking-tasks-to-make-a-graph">
<h1>Linking Tasks To Make a Graph</h1>
<p>Any build system needs a way to link inputs and outputs.
The three markup texts in our discussion above,
for example,
each produce a corresponding HTML output file.
The most natural way to express these relationships
is as a collection of boxes and arrows —
or, in mathematician terminology, <em>nodes</em> and <em>edges</em>
to form a <em>graph</em>:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="figure1.png" src="figure1.png" />
<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Three files generated by parsing three input texts.</p>
</div>
<p>Each language in which a programmer
might tackle writing a build system
will offer various data structures
with which such a graph of nodes and edges might be represented.</p>
<p>How could we represent such a graph in Python?</p>
<p>The Python language gives priority to four generic data structures
by giving them direct support in the language syntax.
You can create new instances of these big-four data structures
by simply typing their literal representation into your source code,
and their four type objects are available as built-in symbols
that can be used without being imported.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The <strong>tuple</strong> is a read-only sequence
used to hold heterogeneous data —
each slot in a tuple typically means something different.
Here, a tuple holds together a hostname and port number,
and would lose its meaning if the elements were re-ordered:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
('dropbox.com', 443)
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <strong>list</strong> is a mutable sequence
used to hold homogenous data —
each item usually has the same structure and meaning as its peers.
Lists can be used either to preserve data’s original input order,
or can be rearranged or sorted
to establish a new and more useful order.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
['C', 'Awk', 'TCL', 'Python', 'JavaScript']
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <strong>set</strong> does not preserve order.
Sets remember only whether a given value has been added,
not how many times,
and are therefore the go-to data structure
for removing duplicates from a data stream.
For example, the following two sets, once the language has built them,
will each have three elements:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
{3, 4, 5}
{3, 4, 5, 4, 4, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5}
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <strong>dict</strong> is an associative data structure for storing values
accessible by a key.
Dicts let the programmer chose the key
by which each value is indexed,
instead of using automatic integer indexing like the tuple and list.
The lookup is backed by a hash table,
which means that dict key lookup runs at the same speed
whether the dict has a dozen or a million keys!</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
{'ssh': 22, 'telnet': 23, 'domain': 53, 'http': 80}
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A key to Python’s flexibility
is that these four data structures are composable.
The programmer can arbitrarily nest them inside each other
to produce more complex data stores
whose rules and syntax remain the simple ones
of the underlying tuples, lists, sets, and dicts.</p>
<p>Given that each of our graph edges needs
to know at least its origin node and its destination node,
the simplest possible representation would be a tuple.
The top edge in Figure&nbsp;1 might look like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
('tutorial.rst', 'tutorial.html')
</pre>
<p>How can we store several edges?
While our initial impulse might be
to simply throw all of our edge tuples into a list,
that would have disadvantages.
A&nbsp;list is careful to maintain order,
but it is not meaningful to talk about an absolute order
for the edges in a graph.
And a list would be perfectly happy to hold several copies
of exactly the same edge,
even though we only want it to be possible
to draw a single arrow between <tt class="docutils literal">tutorial.rst</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">tutorial.html</tt>.
The correct choice is thus the set,
which would have us represent Figure&nbsp;1 as:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
{('tutorial.rst', 'tutorial.html'),
 ('index.rst', 'index.html'),
 ('api.rst', 'api.html')}
</pre>
<p>This would allow quick iteration across all of our edges,
fast insert and delete operations for a single edge,
and a quick way to check whether a particular edge was present.</p>
<!-- TODO: Perhaps demonstrate these operations here? -->
<p>Unfortunately, those are not the only operations we need.</p>
<p>A build system like Contingent
needs to understand the relationship between a given node
and all the nodes connected to it.
For example, when <tt class="docutils literal">api.rst</tt> changes,
Contingent needs to know which assets
are affected by that change, if any,
in order to minimize the work performed
while also ensuring a complete build.
To answer this question —
“what nodes are downstream from <tt class="docutils literal">api.rst</tt>?” —
we need to examine the <em>outgoing</em> edges from <tt class="docutils literal">api.rst</tt>.
But building the dependency graph requires that
Contingent be concerned with a node's <em>inputs</em> as well.
What inputs were used, for example,
when the build system assembled the output document <tt class="docutils literal">tutorial.html</tt>?
It is by watching the input to each node that
Contingent can know that <tt class="docutils literal">api.html</tt> depends on <tt class="docutils literal">api.rst</tt> but
that <tt class="docutils literal">tutorial.html</tt> does not.
As sources change and rebuilds occur,
Contingent rebuilds the incoming edges of each changed node
to remove potentially stale edges
and re-learn which resources a task uses this time around.</p>
<p>Our set-of-tuples does not make answering
either of these questions easy.
If we needed to know the relationship between <tt class="docutils literal">api.html</tt>
and the rest of the graph,
we would need to traverse the entire set
looking for edges that start or end at the <tt class="docutils literal">api.html</tt> node.</p>
<p>An associative data structure like Python's dict
would make these chores easier
by allowing direct lookup of all the edges from a particular node:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
{'tutorial.rst': {('tutorial.rst', 'tutorial.html')},
 'tutorial.html': {('tutorial.rst', 'tutorial.html')},
 'index.rst': {('index.rst', 'index.html')},
 'index.html': {('index.rst', 'index.html')},
 'api.rst': {('api.rst', 'api.html')},
 'api.html': {('api.rst', 'api.html')}}
</pre>
<p>Looking up the edges of a particular node would now be blazingly fast,
at the cost of having to store every edge twice:
once in a set of incoming edges,
and once in a set of outgoing edges.
But the edges in each set would have to be examined manually
to see which are incoming and which are outgoing.
It is also slightly redundant to keep naming the node
over and over again in its set of edges.</p>
<p>The solution to both of these objections
is to place incoming and outgoing edges
in their own separate data structures,
which will also absolve us
of having to mention the node over and over again
for every one of the edges in which it is involved.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
incoming = {
    'tutorial.html': {'tutorial.rst'},
    'index.html': {'index.rst'},
    'api.html': {'api.rst'},
    }

outgoing = {
    'tutorial.rst': {'tutorial.html'},
    'index.rst': {'index.html'},
    'api.rst': {'api.html'},
    }
</pre>
<p>Notice that <tt class="docutils literal">outgoing</tt> represents, directly in Python syntax,
exactly what we drew in Figure 1 earlier:
the source documents on the left
will be transformed by the build system into the
output documents on the right.
For this simple example each source points to only one output —
all the output sets have only one element —
but we will see examples shortly where a single input node
has multiple downstream consequences.</p>
<p>Every edge in this dictionary-of-sets data structure
does get represented twice,
once as an outgoing edge from one node
(<tt class="docutils literal">tutorial.rst</tt> → <tt class="docutils literal">tutorial.html</tt>)
and again as an incoming edge to the other
(<tt class="docutils literal">tutorial.html</tt> ← <tt class="docutils literal">tutorial.rst</tt>).
These two representations capture precisely the same relationship,
just from the opposite perspectives of the two nodes
at either end of the edge.
But in return for this redundancy,
the data structure supports the fast lookup that Contingent needs.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-proper-use-of-classes">
<h1>The Proper Use of Classes</h1>
<p>You may have been surprised
by the absence of classes in the above discussion
of Python data structures.
After all, classes are a frequent mechanism for structuring applications
and a hardly less frequent subject of heated debate
among their adherents and detractors.
Classes were once thought important enough that
entire educational curricula were designed around them,
and the majority of popular programming languanges
include dedicated syntax for defining and using them.</p>
<p>But it turns out that classes are often orthogonal
to the question of data structure design.
Rather than offering us an entirely alternative data modeling paradigm,
classes simply repeat data structures that we have already seen:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A class instance is <em>implemented</em> as a dict.</li>
<li>A class instance is <em>used</em> like a mutable tuple.</li>
</ul>
<p>The class offers key lookup into its attribute dictionary
through a prettier syntax,
where you get to say <tt class="docutils literal">graph.incoming</tt>
instead of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">graph[&quot;incoming&quot;]</span></tt>.
But, in practice, class instances are almost never used
as generic key-value stores.
Instead, they are used to organize related but heterogeneous data
by attribute name,
with implementation details encapsulated behind
a consistent and memorable interface.</p>
<p>So instead of putting a hostname and a port number together in a tuple
and having to remember later which came first and which came second,
you create an <tt class="docutils literal">Address</tt> class
whose instances each have a <tt class="docutils literal">host</tt> and a <tt class="docutils literal">port</tt> attribute.
You can then pass <tt class="docutils literal">Address</tt> objects around
where otherwise you would have had anonymous tuples.
Code becomes easier to read and easier to write.
But using a class instance does not really change
any of the questions we faced above when doing data design:
it just provides a prettier and less anonymous container.</p>
<p>The true value of classes, then,
is not that they change the science of data design.
The value of classes
is that they let you <em>hide</em> your data design from the rest of a program!</p>
<p>Successful application design
hinges upon our ability to exploit
the powerful built-in data structures Python offers us
while minimizing the volume of details we are required to
keep in our heads at any one time.
Classes provide the mechanism for resolving this apparent quandary:
used effectively, a class provides a <em>facade</em>
around some small subset of the system's overall design.
When working within one subset — a <tt class="docutils literal">Graph</tt>, for example —
we can forget the implementation details of other subsets
as long as we can remember their interfaces.
In this way, programmers often find themselves navigating
among several levels of abstraction
in the course of writing a system,
now working with the specific data model and implementation details
for a particular subsystem,
now connecting higher-level concepts through their interfaces.</p>
<p>For example, from the outside,
code can simply ask for a new <tt class="docutils literal">Graph</tt> instance:</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from contingent import graphlib
&gt;&gt;&gt; g = graphlib.Graph()
</pre>
<p>without needing to understand the details of how <tt class="docutils literal">Graph</tt> works.
Code that is simply using the graph
sees only interface verbs — the method calls —
when manipulating a graph,
as when an edge is added or some other operation performed:</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; g.add_edge('index.rst', 'index.html')
&gt;&gt;&gt; g.add_edge('tutorial.rst', 'tutorial.html')
&gt;&gt;&gt; g.add_edge('api.rst', 'api.html')
</pre>
<p>Careful readers will have noticed that we added edges to our graph
without explicitly creating “node” and “edge” objects,
and that the nodes themselves in these early examples
are simply strings.
Coming from other languages and traditions,
one might have expected to see
user-defined classes and interfaces for everything in the system:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Graph g = new ConcreteGraph();
Node indexRstNode = new StringNode(&quot;index.rst&quot;);
Node indexHtmlNode = new StringNode(&quot;index.html&quot;);
Edge indexEdge = new DirectedEdge(indexRstNode, indexHtmlNode);
g.addEdge(indexEdge);
</pre>
<p>The Python language and community explicitly and intentionally emphasize
using simple, generic data structures to solve problems,
instead of creating custom classes for every minute detail
of the problem we want to tackle.
This is one facet of the notion of “Pythonic” solutions that you may
have read about.
Pythonic solutions try to
minimize syntactic overhead
and leverage Python's powerful built-in tools
and extensive standard library.</p>
<p>With these considerations in mind,
let’s return to the <tt class="docutils literal">Graph</tt> class,
examining its design and implmentation to see
the interplay between data structures and class interfaces.
When a new <tt class="docutils literal">Graph</tt> instance is constructed,
a pair of dictionaries has already been built
to store edges using the logic we outlined in the previous section:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="name class">Graph</span><span class="punctuation">:</span>
    <span class="literal string">&quot;&quot;&quot;A directed graph of the relationships among build tasks.</span>
</pre>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
    <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="name function">__init__</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name builtin pseudo">self</span><span class="punctuation">):</span>
        <span class="name builtin pseudo">self</span><span class="operator">.</span><span class="name">_inputs_of</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="name">defaultdict</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name builtin">set</span><span class="punctuation">)</span>
        <span class="name builtin pseudo">self</span><span class="operator">.</span><span class="name">_consequences_of</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="name">defaultdict</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name builtin">set</span><span class="punctuation">)</span>
</pre>
<p>The leading underscore
in front of the attribute names <tt class="docutils literal">_inputs_of</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">_consequences_of</tt>
is a common convention in the Python community
to signal that an attribute is private.
This convention is one way the community suggests
that programmers pass messages and warnings
through space and time to each other.
Recognizing the need to signal differences among
public versus internal object attributes,
the community adopted the single leading underscore
as a concise and fairly consistent indicator
to other programmers,
including our future selves,
that the attribute is best treated
as part of the invisible internal machinery of the class.</p>
<p>Why are we using a “defaultdict” instead of a standard dict?
A common problem when composing dicts
with other data structures is handling missing keys.
With a normal dict,
retrieving a key that does not exist raises a <tt class="docutils literal">KeyError</tt>:</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; consequences_of = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; consequences_of['index.rst'].add('index.html')
Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
KeyError: 'index.rst'
</pre>
<p>Using a normal dict requires special checks throughout the code
to handle this specific case, for example when adding a new edge:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="comment"># Special case to handle “we have not seen this task yet”:</span>

<span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="name">input_task</span> <span class="operator word">not</span> <span class="operator word">in</span> <span class="name builtin pseudo">self</span><span class="operator">.</span><span class="name">_consequences_of</span><span class="punctuation">:</span>
    <span class="name builtin pseudo">self</span><span class="operator">.</span><span class="name">_consequences_of</span><span class="punctuation">[</span><span class="name">input_task</span><span class="punctuation">]</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="name builtin">set</span><span class="punctuation">()</span>

<span class="name builtin pseudo">self</span><span class="operator">.</span><span class="name">_consequences_of</span><span class="punctuation">[</span><span class="name">input_task</span><span class="punctuation">]</span><span class="operator">.</span><span class="name">add</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name">consequence_task</span><span class="punctuation">)</span>
</pre>
<p>This need is so common that Python includes a special utility,
the defaultdict, which lets you provide a function
that returns a value for absent keys.
When we ask about an edge that the <tt class="docutils literal">Graph</tt> hasn't yet seen,
we will get back an empty <tt class="docutils literal">set</tt> instead of an exception:</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import defaultdict
&gt;&gt;&gt; consequences_of = defaultdict(set)
&gt;&gt;&gt; consequences_of['api.rst']
set()
</pre>
<p>Structuring our implementation this way means that
each key’s first use can look identical
to second-and-subsequent-times that a particular key is used:</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; consequences_of['index.rst'].add('index.html')
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'index.html' in consequences_of['index.rst']
True
</pre>
<p>Given these techniques, let’s examine the implementation
of <tt class="docutils literal">add_edge</tt>, which we earlier used
to build the graph for Figure&nbsp;1:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
    <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="name function">add_edge</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name builtin pseudo">self</span><span class="punctuation">,</span> <span class="name">input_task</span><span class="punctuation">,</span> <span class="name">consequence_task</span><span class="punctuation">):</span>
        <span class="literal string doc">&quot;&quot;&quot;Add an edge: `consequence_task` uses the output of `input_task`.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
        <span class="name builtin pseudo">self</span><span class="operator">.</span><span class="name">_consequences_of</span><span class="punctuation">[</span><span class="name">input_task</span><span class="punctuation">]</span><span class="operator">.</span><span class="name">add</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name">consequence_task</span><span class="punctuation">)</span>
        <span class="name builtin pseudo">self</span><span class="operator">.</span><span class="name">_inputs_of</span><span class="punctuation">[</span><span class="name">consequence_task</span><span class="punctuation">]</span><span class="operator">.</span><span class="name">add</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name">input_task</span><span class="punctuation">)</span>
</pre>
<p>This method hides the fact that two, not one,
storage steps are required for each new edge
so that we know about it in both directions.
And notice how <tt class="docutils literal">add_edge()</tt> does not know or care
whether either node has been seen before.
Because the inputs and consequences data structures
are each a <tt class="docutils literal">defaultdict(set)</tt>,
the <tt class="docutils literal">add_edge()</tt> method remains blissfully ignorant
as to the novelty of a node —
the <tt class="docutils literal">defaultdict</tt> takes care of the difference
by creating a new <tt class="docutils literal">set</tt> object on the fly.
As we saw above, <tt class="docutils literal">add_edge()</tt> would be
three times longer had we not used <tt class="docutils literal">defaultdict</tt>.
More importantly, it would be more difficult
to understand and reason about the resulting code.
This implementation demonstrates a Pythonic
approach to problems: simple, direct, and concise.</p>
<p>Callers should also be given a simple way to visit every edge
without having to learn how to traverse our data structure:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
    <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="name function">edges</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name builtin pseudo">self</span><span class="punctuation">):</span>
        <span class="literal string doc">&quot;&quot;&quot;Return all edges as ``(input_task, consequence_task)`` tuples.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="punctuation">[(</span><span class="name">a</span><span class="punctuation">,</span> <span class="name">b</span><span class="punctuation">)</span> <span class="keyword">for</span> <span class="name">a</span> <span class="operator word">in</span> <span class="name builtin pseudo">self</span><span class="operator">.</span><span class="name">sorted</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name builtin pseudo">self</span><span class="operator">.</span><span class="name">_consequences_of</span><span class="punctuation">)</span>
                       <span class="keyword">for</span> <span class="name">b</span> <span class="operator word">in</span> <span class="name builtin pseudo">self</span><span class="operator">.</span><span class="name">sorted</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name builtin pseudo">self</span><span class="operator">.</span><span class="name">_consequences_of</span><span class="punctuation">[</span><span class="name">a</span><span class="punctuation">])]</span>
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">Graph.sorted()</tt> method, if you want to examine it later,
makes an attempt to sort the nodes
in case they have a natural sort order
(such as alphabetical)
that can provide a stable output order for the user.</p>
<p>By using this traversal method we can see that,
following our three “add” method calls earlier,
<tt class="docutils literal">g</tt> now represents the same graph that we saw in Figure&nbsp;1.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from pprint import pprint
&gt;&gt;&gt; pprint(g.edges())
[('api.rst', 'api.html'),
 ('index.rst', 'index.html'),
 ('tutorial.rst', 'tutorial.html')]
</pre>
<p>Since we now have a real live Python object,
and not just a figure,
we can ask it interesting questions!
For example, when Contingent is building a blog from source files,
it will need to know things like “What depends on <tt class="docutils literal">api.rst</tt>?” when
the content of <tt class="docutils literal">api.rst</tt> changes:</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; g.immediate_consequences_of('api.rst')
['api.html']
</pre>
<p>This <tt class="docutils literal">Graph</tt> is telling Contingent that,
when <tt class="docutils literal">api.rst</tt> changes,
<tt class="docutils literal">api.html</tt> is now stale and must be rebuilt.
How about <tt class="docutils literal">index.html</tt>?</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; g.immediate_consequences_of('index.html')
[]
</pre>
<p>An empty list has been returned,
signalling that <tt class="docutils literal">index.html</tt> is at the right edge of the graph
and so nothing further needs to be rebuilt if it changes.
This query can be expressed very simply
thanks to the work that has already gone in to laying out our data:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
    <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="name function">immediate_consequences_of</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name builtin pseudo">self</span><span class="punctuation">,</span> <span class="name">task</span><span class="punctuation">):</span>
        <span class="literal string doc">&quot;&quot;&quot;Return the tasks that use `task` as an input.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="name builtin pseudo">self</span><span class="operator">.</span><span class="name">sorted</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name builtin pseudo">self</span><span class="operator">.</span><span class="name">_consequences_of</span><span class="punctuation">[</span><span class="name">task</span><span class="punctuation">])</span>
</pre>
<!-- >>> from contingent.rendering import as_graphviz
>>> open('figure1.dot', 'w').write(as_graphviz(g)) and None -->
<p>Figure&nbsp;1 ignored one of the most important relationships
that we discovered in the opening section of our chapter:
the way that document titles appear in the table of contents.
Let’s fill in this detail.
We will create a node for each title string
that needs to be generated by parsing an input file
and then passed to one of our other routines:</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; g.add_edge('api.rst', 'api-title')
&gt;&gt;&gt; g.add_edge('api-title', 'index.html')
&gt;&gt;&gt; g.add_edge('tutorial.rst', 'tutorial-title')
&gt;&gt;&gt; g.add_edge('tutorial-title', 'index.html')
</pre>
<p>The result is a graph that could properly handle
rebuilding the table of contents that we discussed
in the opening of this chapter.</p>
<!-- >>> open('figure2.dot', 'w').write(as_graphviz(g)) and None -->
<div class="figure">
<img alt="figure2.png" src="figure2.png" />
<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Being prepared to rebuild <tt class="docutils literal">index.html</tt>
whenever any title that it mentions gets changed.</p>
</div>
<p>This manual walk-through illustrates what we
will eventually have Contingent do for us:
the graph <tt class="docutils literal">g</tt> captures the inputs and consequences
for the various artifacts in our project's documentation.</p>
<!-- I wonder if we should defer talking about clear_inputs_of() until -->
<!-- later, rather than trying to conjure up a motivation for it here. -->
</div>
<div class="section" id="learning-connections">
<h1>Learning Connections</h1>
<p>We now have a way for Contingent
to keep track of tasks and the relationships between them.
If we look more closely at Figure 2, however,
we see that it is actually a little hand wavy and vague:
<em>how</em> is <tt class="docutils literal">api.html</tt> produced from <tt class="docutils literal">api.rst</tt>?
How do we know that <tt class="docutils literal">index.html</tt> needs the title from the tutorial?
And how is this dependency resolved?</p>
<p>Our intuitive notion of these ideas
served when we were constructing consequences graphs by hand,
but unfortunately computers are not terribly intuitive,
so we will need to be more precise about what we want.</p>
<p>What are the steps required to produce output from sources?
How are these steps defined and executed?
And how can Contingent know the connections between them?</p>
<p>In Contingent, build tasks are modeled as functions plus arguments.
The functions define actions that a particular project
understands how to perform.
The arguments provide
the specifics: <em>which</em> source document should be read,
<em>which</em> blog title is needed.
As they are running,
these functions may in turn invoke <em>other</em> task functions,
passing whatever arguments they need answers for.</p>
<p>To see how this works, we will actually now implement
the documentation builder described at the beginning of the chapter.
In order to prevent ourselves from wallowing around in a bog of details,
for this illustration we will work with
simplified input and output document formats.
Our input documents will consist of a title on the first line,
with the remainder of the text forming the body.
Cross references will simply be source file names
enclosed in back ticks,
which on output are replaced with the title
from the corresponding document in the output.</p>
<p>Here is the content of our example
<tt class="docutils literal">index.txt</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">api.txt</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">tutorial.txt</tt>,
illustrating titles, document bodies, and cross-references
from our little document format:</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; index = &quot;&quot;&quot;
... Table of Contents
... -----------------
... * `tutorial.txt`
... * `api.txt`
... &quot;&quot;&quot;
</pre>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; tutorial = &quot;&quot;&quot;
... Beginners Tutorial
... ------------------
... Welcome to the tutorial!
... We hope you enjoy it.
... &quot;&quot;&quot;
</pre>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; api = &quot;&quot;&quot;
... API Reference
... -------------
... You might want to read
... the `tutorial.txt` first.
... &quot;&quot;&quot;
</pre>
<!-- TODO: these next few paragraphs need some smoothing and redundancy removal. -->
<p>Now that we have some source material to work with,
what functions would a Contingent-based blog builder
need?</p>
<p>In the simplistic examples above,
the HTML output files proceed directly from the source,
but in a realistic system,
turning source into markup involves several steps:
reading the raw text from disk,
parsing the text to a convenient internal representation,
processing any directives the author may have specified,
resolving cross-references or other external dependencies
(such as include files),
and applying one or more view transformations
to convert the internal representation to its output form.</p>
<p>Contingent manages tasks by grouping them into a <tt class="docutils literal">Project</tt>,
a sort of build system busybody
that injects itself into the middle of the build process,
noting every time one task talks to another
to construct a graph of the relationships between all the tasks.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from contingent.projectlib import Project, Task
&gt;&gt;&gt; project = Project()
&gt;&gt;&gt; task = project.task
</pre>
<p>A build system for the example given at the beginning of the chapter
might involve a few basic tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Our <tt class="docutils literal">read()</tt> task will pretend to read the files from disk.
Since we really defined the source text in variables,
all it needs to do is convert from a filename
to the corresponding text.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; filesystem = {'index.txt': index,
...               'tutorial.txt': tutorial,
...               'api.txt': api}
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; &#64;task
... def read(filename):
...     return filesystem[filename]
</pre>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <tt class="docutils literal">parse()</tt> task interprets the raw text of the file contents
according to the specification of our document format.
Our format is very simple:
the title of the document appears on the first line,
and the rest of the content is considered the document's body.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; &#64;task
... def parse(filename):
...     lines = read(filename).strip().splitlines()
...     title = lines[0]
...     body = '\n'.join(lines[2:])
...     return title, body
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the format is so simple,
the parser is a little silly, admittedly,
but it illustrates the interpretive responsibilities
that parsers are required to carry out.
Parsing in general is a very interesting subject
and many books have been written
either partially or completely dedicated to it.
In a system like Sphinx,
the parser must understand the many markup tokens,
directives, and commands defined by the system,
transforming the input text into something
the rest of the system can work with.</p>
<p>Notice the connection point between
<tt class="docutils literal">parse()</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">read()</tt> —
the first task in parsing is to pass the filename it has been given
to <tt class="docutils literal">read()</tt>, which finds and returns the contents of that file.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <tt class="docutils literal">title_of()</tt> task, given a source file name,
returns the document's title:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; &#64;task
... def title_of(filename):
...     title, body = parse(filename)
...     return title
</pre>
</blockquote>
<!-- TODO: something is wrong with the next paragraph; looks like a bad -->
<!-- edit -->
<p>This task nicely illustrates the
separation of responsibilities between
the parts of a document processing system.
The <tt class="docutils literal">title_of()</tt> function works directly
from an in-memory representation of a document —
in this case, a tuple —
instead of taking it upon itself to re-parse
the entire document again just to find the title.
The <tt class="docutils literal">parse()</tt> function alone produces the in-memory representation,
in accordance with the contract of the system specification,
and the rest of the blog builder processing functions
like <tt class="docutils literal">title_of()</tt> simply use its output as their authority.</p>
<p>If you are coming from an orthodox object-oriented tradition,
this function-oriented design may look a little weird.
In an OO solution,
<tt class="docutils literal">parse()</tt> would return some sort of <tt class="docutils literal">Document</tt> object
that has <tt class="docutils literal">title_of()</tt> as a method or property.
In fact, Sphinx works exactly this way:
its <tt class="docutils literal">Parser</tt> subsystem produces a “Docutils document tree” object
for the other parts of the system to use.</p>
<p>Contingent is not opinionated
with regard to these differing design paradigms
and supports either approach equally well.
For this chapter we are keeping things simple.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The final task,
<tt class="docutils literal">render()</tt>,
turns the in-memory representation of a document
into an output form.
It is, in effect, the inverse of <tt class="docutils literal">parse()</tt>.
Whereas <tt class="docutils literal">parse()</tt> takes an input document
conforming to a specification
and converts it to an in-memory representation,
<tt class="docutils literal">render()</tt> takes an in-memory representation
and produces an output document
conforming to some specification.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; LINK = '&lt;a href=&quot;{}&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/a&gt;'

</ul>
<p>Here is an example run
that will invoke every stage of the above logic —
rendering <tt class="docutils literal">tutorial.txt</tt> to produce its output:</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(render('tutorial.txt'))
&lt;h1&gt;Beginners Tutorial&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Welcome to the tutorial!
We hope you enjoy it.
&lt;p&gt;
</pre>
<p>Figure 3 illustrates the task graph
that transitively connects all the tasks
required to produce the output,
from reading the input file,
parsing and transforming the document,
and rendering the result:</p>
<!-- >>> open('figure3.dot', 'w').write(as_graphviz(project._graph)) and None -->
<img alt="figure3.png" src="figure3.png" />
<p>It turns out that Figure 3 was not hand-drawn for this chapter,
but has been generated directly from Contingent!
Building this graph is possible for the <tt class="docutils literal">Project</tt> object
because it maintains its own call stack,
similar to the stack of live execution frames
that Python maintains to remember which function to continue running
when the current one returns.</p>
<p>Every time that a new task is invoked,
Contingent can assume that it has been called —
and that its output will be used —
by the task currently at the top of the stack.
Maintaining the stack will require that several extra steps
surround the invocation of a task&nbsp;<em>T</em>:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Push <em>T</em> onto the stack.</li>
<li>Execute <em>T</em>, letting it call any other tasks it needs.</li>
<li>Pop <em>T</em> off the stack.</li>
<li>Return its result.</li>
</ol>
<p>To intercept task calls,
the <tt class="docutils literal">Project</tt> leverages a key Python feature: <em>function decorators</em>.
A&nbsp;decorator is allowed to process or transform a function
at the moment that it is being defined.
The <tt class="docutils literal">Project.task</tt> decorator uses this opportunity
to package every task inside another function, a <em>wrapper</em>,
which allows a clean separation of responsibilities
between the wrapper —
which will worry about graph and stack management
on behalf of the Project —
and our task functions that focus on document processing.
Here is what the <tt class="docutils literal">task</tt> decorator boilerplate looks like:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="keyword namespace">from</span> <span class="name namespace">functools</span> <span class="keyword namespace">import</span> <span class="name">wraps</span>

<span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="name function">task</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name">function</span><span class="punctuation">):</span>
    <span class="name decorator">&#64;wraps</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name">function</span><span class="punctuation">)</span>
    <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="name function">wrapper</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="operator">*</span><span class="name">args</span><span class="punctuation">):</span>
        <span class="comment"># wrapper body, that will call function()</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="name">wrapper</span>
</pre>
<p>This is an entirely typical Python decorator declaration.
It can then be applied to a function
by naming it after a <tt class="docutils literal">&#64;</tt> character atop the <tt class="docutils literal">def</tt>
that creates the function:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="name decorator">&#64;task</span>
<span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="name function">title_of</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name">filename</span><span class="punctuation">):</span>
    <span class="name">title</span><span class="punctuation">,</span> <span class="name">body</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="name">parse</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name">filename</span><span class="punctuation">)</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="name">title</span>
</pre>
<p>When this definition is complete,
the name <tt class="docutils literal">title_of</tt> will refer
to the wrapped version of the function.
The wrapper can access the original version of the function
via the name <tt class="docutils literal">function</tt>,
calling it at the appropriate time.
The body of the Contingent wrapper
runs something like this:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="name function">task</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name">function</span><span class="punctuation">):</span>

        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="name">value</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="name">wrapper</span>
</pre>
<p>This wrapper performs several crucial maintenance steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Packages the task —
a function plus its arguments —
into a small object for convenience.
The <tt class="docutils literal">wrapper</tt> here names the wrapped version of the task function.</li>
<li>If this task has been invoked
by a current task that is already underway,
add an edge capturing the fact that
this task is an input to the already-running task.</li>
<li>Forget whatever we might have learned last time about the task,
since it might make new decisions this time —
if the source text of the API guide no longer mentions the Tutorial,
for example, then its <tt class="docutils literal">render()</tt> will no longer ask
for the <tt class="docutils literal">title_of()</tt> the Tutorial document.</li>
<li>Push this task onto the top of the task stack
in case it decides, in its turn, to invoke further tasks
in the course of doing its work.</li>
<li>Invoke the task
inside of a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">try...finally</span></tt> block
that ensures we correctly remove the finished task from the stack
even if it dies by raising an exception.</li>
<li>Return the task’s return value,
so that callers of this wrapper
will not be able to tell that they have not simply invoked
the plain task function itself.</li>
</ol>
<p>Steps 4 and 5 maintain the task stack itself,
which is then used by step 2 to perform the consequences tracking
that is our whole reason for building a task stack in the first place.</p>
<p>Since each task gets surrounded by its own copy of the wrapper function,
the mere invocation and execution of the normal stack of tasks
will produce a graph of relationships as an invisible side effect.
That is why we were careful to use the wrapper
around every one of the processing steps we defined:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="name decorator">&#64;task</span>
<span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="name function">read</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name">filename</span><span class="punctuation">):</span>
    <span class="comment"># body of read</span>

<span class="name decorator">&#64;task</span>
<span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="name function">parse</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name">filename</span><span class="punctuation">):</span>
    <span class="comment"># body of parse</span>

<span class="name decorator">&#64;task</span>
<span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="name function">title_of</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name">filename</span><span class="punctuation">):</span>
    <span class="comment"># body of title_of</span>

<span class="name decorator">&#64;task</span>
<span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="name function">render</span><span class="punctuation">(</span><span class="name">filename</span><span class="punctuation">):</span>
    <span class="comment"># body of render</span>
</pre>
<p>Thanks to these wrappers,
when we called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">parse('tutorial.txt')</span></tt>
the decorator learned
the connection between <tt class="docutils literal">parse</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">read</tt>.
We can ask about the relationship by building another <tt class="docutils literal">Task</tt> tuple
and asking what the consequences would be
if its output value changed:</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; task = Task(read, ('tutorial.txt',))
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(task)
read('tutorial.txt')
&gt;&gt;&gt; project._graph.immediate_consequences_of(task)
[parse('tutorial.txt')]
</pre>
<p>The consequence of re-reading the <tt class="docutils literal">tutorial.txt</tt> file
and finding its contents have changed
is that we need to re-execute the <tt class="docutils literal">parse()</tt> routine for that document.
What happens if we render the entire set of documents?
Will Contingent be able to learn the entire build process
with its interrelationships?</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; for filename in 'index.txt', 'tutorial.txt', 'api.txt':
...     print(render(filename))
...     print('=' * 30)
...
&lt;h1&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
* &lt;a href=&quot;tutorial.txt&quot;&gt;Beginners Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href=&quot;api.txt&quot;&gt;API Reference&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Welcome to the tutorial!
We hope you enjoy it.
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;API Reference&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You might want to read
the &lt;a href=&quot;tutorial.txt&quot;&gt;Beginners Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; first.
&lt;p&gt;
==============================
</pre>
<p>It worked!
From the output, we can see that
our transform substited the docuent titles
for the directives in our source docuents,
indicating that Contingent was able to
discover the connections between the various tasks
needed to build our documents.</p>
<!-- >>> open('figure4.dot', 'w').write(as_graphviz(project._graph)) and None -->
<div class="figure">
<img alt="figure4.png" src="figure4.png" />
<p class="caption"><strong>Figure&nbsp;4.</strong> The complete set of relationships
between our input files and our HTML outputs.</p>
</div>
<p>By watching one task invoke another
through the <tt class="docutils literal">task</tt> wrapper machinery,
<tt class="docutils literal">Project</tt> has automatically learned
the graph of inputs and consequences.
Since it has a complete consequences graph
at its disposal,
Contingent knows all the things to rebuild
if the inputs to any tasks change.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chasing-consequences">
<h1>Chasing Consequences</h1>
<p>Once the initial build has run to completion,
Contingent needs to monitor the input files for changes.
When the user finishes a new edit and runs “Save,”
both the <tt class="docutils literal">read()</tt> method and its consequences need to be invoked.</p>
<p>This will require us to walk the graph in the opposite order
from the one in which it was created.
It was built, you will recall, by calling
<tt class="docutils literal">render()</tt> for the API Reference and having that call <tt class="docutils literal">parse()</tt>
which finally invoked the <tt class="docutils literal">read()</tt> task.
Now we go in the other direction:
we know that <tt class="docutils literal">read()</tt> will now return new content,
and we need to figure out what consequences lie downstream.</p>
<p>The process of compiling consequences is a recursive one,
as each consequence can itself have further tasks that depended on it.
We could perform this recursion manually
through repeated calls to the graph
(note that we are here taking advantage
of the fact that the Python prompt saves the last value displayed
under the name <tt class="docutils literal">_</tt> for use in the subsequent expression):</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; task = Task(read, ('api.txt',))
&gt;&gt;&gt; project._graph.immediate_consequences_of(task)
[parse('api.txt')]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t1, = _
&gt;&gt;&gt; project._graph.immediate_consequences_of(t1)
[render('api.txt'), title_of('api.txt')]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t2, t3 = _
&gt;&gt;&gt; project._graph.immediate_consequences_of(t2)
[]
&gt;&gt;&gt; project._graph.immediate_consequences_of(t3)
[render('index.txt')]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t4, = _
&gt;&gt;&gt; project._graph.immediate_consequences_of(t4)
[]
</pre>
<p>This recursive task of looking repeatedly for immediate consequences
and only stopping when we arrive at tasks with no further consequences
is a basic enough graph operation that it is supported directly
by a method on the <tt class="docutils literal">Graph</tt> class:</p>
<!-- Secretly adjust pprint to a narrower-than-usual width:

>>> _pprint = pprint
>>> pprint = lambda x: _pprint(x, width=40) -->
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; pprint(project._graph.recursive_consequences_of([task]))
[parse('api.txt'),
 render('api.txt'),
 title_of('api.txt'),
 render('index.txt')]
</pre>
<p>In fact, <tt class="docutils literal">recursive_consequences_of()</tt> tries to be a bit clever.
If a particular task appears repeatedly as a downstream consequence
of several other tasks,
then it is careful to only mention it once in the output list,
and to move it close to the end
so that it appears only after the tasks that are its inputs.
This intelligence is powered by the classic depth-first implementation
of a topological sort,
an algorithm which winds up being fairly easy to write in Python
through a hidden a recursive helper function.
Check out the <tt class="docutils literal">graphlib.py</tt> source code for the details.</p>
<p>If upon detecting a change
we are careful to re-run every task in the recursive consequences,
then Contingent will be able to avoid rebuilding too little.
Our second challenge, however,
was to avoid rebuilding too much.
Refer again to Figure&nbsp;4.
We want to avoid rebuilding all three documents
every time that <tt class="docutils literal">tutorial.txt</tt> is changed,
since most edits will probably not affect its title but only its body.
How can this be accomplished?</p>
<p>The solution is to make graph recomputation dependent on caching.
When stepping forward through the recursive consequences of a change,
we will only invoke tasks whose inputs are different than last time.</p>
<p>This optimization will involve a final data structure.
We will give the <tt class="docutils literal">Project</tt> a <tt class="docutils literal">_todo</tt> set
with which to remember every task
for which at least one input value has changed,
and that therefore requires re-execution.
Because only tasks in <tt class="docutils literal">_todo</tt> are out-of-date,
the build process can skip running any other tasks
unless they appear there.</p>
<p>Again, Python’s convenient and unified design
makes these features very easy to code.
Because task objects are hashable,
<tt class="docutils literal">_todo</tt> can simply be a set
that remembers task items by identity —
guaranteeing that a task never appears twice —
and the <tt class="docutils literal">_cache</tt> of return values from previous runs
can be a dict with tasks as keys.</p>
<p>More precisely, the rebuild step must keep looping
as long as <tt class="docutils literal">_todo</tt> is non-empty.
During each loop, it should:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Call <tt class="docutils literal">recursive_consequences_of()</tt>
and pass in every task listed in <tt class="docutils literal">_todo</tt>.
The return value will be a list
of not only the <tt class="docutils literal">_todo</tt> tasks themselves,
but also every task downstream of them —
every task, in other words, that could possibly need re-execution
if the outputs come out different this time.</li>
<li>For each task in the list,
check whether it is listed in <tt class="docutils literal">_todo</tt>.
If not, then we can skip running it,
because none of the tasks that we have re-invoked upstream of it
has produced a new return value
that would require the task’s recomputation.</li>
<li>But for any task that is indeed listed in <tt class="docutils literal">_todo</tt>
by the time we reach it,
we need to ask it to re-run and re-compute its return value.
If the task wrapper function detects that this return value
does not match the old cached value,
then its downstream tasks will be automatically added to <tt class="docutils literal">_todo</tt>
before we reach them in the list of recursive consequences.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the time we reach the end of the list,
every task that could possibly need to be re-run
should in fact have been re-run.
But just in case, we will check <tt class="docutils literal">_todo</tt>
and try again if it is not yet empty.
Even for very rapidly changing dependency trees,
this should quickly settle out.
Only a cycle —
where, for example, task <em>A</em> needs the output of task <em>B</em>
which itself needs the output of task <em>A</em> —
could keep the builder in an infinite loop,
and only if their return values never stabilize.
Fortunately, real-world build tasks are typically without cycles.</p>
<p>Let us trace the behavior of this system through an example.</p>
<p>Suppose you edit <tt class="docutils literal">tutorial.txt</tt>
and change both the title and the body content.
We can simulate this by modifying the value
in our <tt class="docutils literal">filesystem</tt> dict:</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; filesystem['tutorial.txt'] = &quot;&quot;&quot;
... The Coder Tutorial
... ------------------
... This is a new and improved
... introductory paragraph.
... &quot;&quot;&quot;
</pre>
<p>Now that the contents have changed,
we can ask the Project to re-run the <tt class="docutils literal">read()</tt> task
by using its <tt class="docutils literal">cache_off()</tt> context manager
that temporarily disables its willingness
to return its old cached result for a given task and argument:</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; with project.cache_off():
...     text = read('tutorial.txt')
</pre>
<p>The new tutorial text has now been read into the cache.
How many downstream tasks will need to be re-executed?</p>
<p>To help us answer this question,
the <tt class="docutils literal">Project</tt> class supports a simple tracing facility
that will tell us which tasks are executed in the course
of a rebuild.
Since the above change to <tt class="docutils literal">tutorial.txt</tt>
affects both its body and its title,
everything downstream will need to be re-computed:</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; project.start_tracing()
&gt;&gt;&gt; project.rebuild()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(project.stop_tracing())
calling parse('tutorial.txt')
calling render('tutorial.txt')
calling title_of('tutorial.txt')
calling render('api.txt')
calling render('index.txt')
</pre>
<p>Looking back at Figure&nbsp;4,
you can see that, as expected,
this is every task that is an immediate or downstream consequence
of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">read('tutorial.txt')</span></tt>.</p>
<p>But what if we edit it again,
but this time leave the title the same?</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; filesystem['tutorial.txt'] = &quot;&quot;&quot;
... The Coder Tutorial
... ------------------
... Welcome to the coder tutorial!
... It should be read top to bottom.
... &quot;&quot;&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; with project.cache_off():
...     text = read('tutorial.txt')
</pre>
<p>This small, limited change
should have no effect on the other documents.</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; project.start_tracing()
&gt;&gt;&gt; project.rebuild()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(project.stop_tracing())
calling parse('tutorial.txt')
calling render('tutorial.txt')
calling title_of('tutorial.txt')
</pre>
<p>Success!
Only one document got rebuilt.
The fact that <tt class="docutils literal">title_of()</tt>, given a new input document,
nevertheless returned the same value means that all further
downstream tasks were insulated from the change
and did not get re-invoked.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>There exist languages and programming methodologies
under which Contingent would be a suffocating forest of tiny classes
giving useless and verbose names to every concept in the problem domain.</p>
<p>When programming Contingent in Python, however,
we skipped the creation of a dozen classes that could have existed,
like <tt class="docutils literal">TaskArgument</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">CachedResult</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">ConsequenceList</tt>.
We instead drew upon Python’s strong tradition
of solving generic problems with generic data structures,
resulting in code that repeatedly uses a small set of ideas
from the core data structures tuple, list, set, and dict.</p>
<p>But does this not cause a problem?</p>
<p>Generic data structures are also, by their nature, anonymous.
Our <tt class="docutils literal">project._cache</tt> is a set.
So is every collection of upstream and downstream nodes
inside the <tt class="docutils literal">Graph</tt>.
Are we in danger of seeing generic <tt class="docutils literal">set</tt> error messages
and not knowing whether to look in the project or the graph
implementation for the error?</p>
<p>In fact, we are not in danger!</p>
<p>Thanks to the careful discipline of encapsulation —
of only allowing <tt class="docutils literal">Graph</tt> code to touch the graph’s sets,
and <tt class="docutils literal">Project</tt> code to touch the project’s set —
there will never be ambiguity if a set operation
returns an error during a later phase of the project.
The name of the innermost executing method at the moment of the error
will necessarily direct us to exactly the class, and set,
involved in the mistake.
There is no need to create a subclass of <tt class="docutils literal">set</tt>
for every possible application of the data type,
so long as we put that conventional underscore in front of data
structure attributes and then are careful not to touch them
from code outside of the class.</p>
<p>Contingent demonstrates how crucial the Facade pattern,
from the epochal <em>Design Patterns</em> book,
is for a well-designed Python program.
Not every data structure and fragment of data in a Python program
gets to be its own class.
Instead, classes are used sparingly,
at conceptual pivots in the code where a big idea —
like the idea of a dependency graph —
can be wrapped up into a Facade
that hides the details of the simple generic data structures
that lie beneath it.</p>
<p>Code outside of the Facade
names the big concepts that it needs
and the operations that it wants to perform.
Inside of the Facade,
the programmer manipulates the small and convenient moving parts
of the Python programming language to make the operations happen.</p>
